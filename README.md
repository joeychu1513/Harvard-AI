## Projects
  - Search:
    - [Degrees](./Project%20Search%20-%20Degree/) : Program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are, based on [IMBb](https://imdb.com)
    - [Tic-Tac-Toe](./Project%20Search%20-%20Tic%20Tac%20Toe/) : Using Minimax game theory, implementation of an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.
  - Knowledge:
    - [Knights](./Project%20Knowledge%20-%20Knights/) : Solves three classic Knights and Knave Puzzles using Symbolic Logic.
    - [Minesweeper](./Project%20Knowledge%20-%20Minesweeper/) : An AI to play Minesweeper.
  - Uncertainty:
    - [PageRank](./Project%20Uncertainty%20-%20Pagerank/) : Using a Random Surfer Markov Chain and an Iterative Algorithm, write an AI to rank web pages by importance.
    - [Heredity](./Project%20Uncertainty%20-%20Heredity/) : An AI to predict the likelihood of a person having a genetic trait, using a Bayesian Network, and Inference by Enumeration.
  - Optimization
    - [Crossword](./Project%20Optimisation%20-%20Crossword/) : An AI to generate crossword puzzles, using a constraint satisfaction problem model with node consistency, arc consistency and backtracking search.
  - Learning
    - [Shopping](./Project%20Learning%20-%20Shopping/) : An AI to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase, using the Scikit-Learn k-Nearest Neighbours classifier.
    - [Nim](./Project%20Learning%20-%20Nim/) : An AI that teaches itself to play Nim through reinforcement learning, using the ε-Greedy Q-Learning method.
  - Neural Networks
    - [Traffic](./Project%20Neural%20Networks%20-%20Traffic/) : An AI to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph, using a tensorflow convolutional neural network.
  - Language
    - [Parser](./Project%20Language%20-%20Parser/) : An AI to parse sentences and extract noun phrases, using the context-free grammar formalism and the Python nltk library.
    - [Questions](./Project%20Language%20-%20Questions/) : An AI that answers questions, by determining the most relevant document(s) using tf-idf ranking and then extracting the most relevant sentence(s) using idf and a query term density measure.
